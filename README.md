# 100-Designs-in-Code
Welcome to 100 Designs in Code! This repository is part of a 100-day challenge where I take real-world designs and recreate them using HTML and CSS. The goal is to improve my web development skills by transforming visual designs into functional and responsive web components.

# What to Expect
**100 Projects:** Each project corresponds to a real-world design, showcasing how it can be translated into web code.

**HTML & CSS:** All designs are implemented using HTML for structure and CSS for styling.

**Learning Focus:** Emphasis on practical application of web design principles, responsiveness, and CSS animations.

Feel free to explore the projects and provide feedback :)
